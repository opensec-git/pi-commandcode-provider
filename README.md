> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an unofficial, community-maintained integration. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by CommandCode. You need your own account and a plan with [Provider API access](https://commandcode.ai/docs/provider).

## Why this package

- **Native Pi streaming** through Pi's maintained OpenAI and Anthropic adapters
- **Full agent loops** with incremental tool arguments, reasoning, images, usage, aborts, and retries
- **Stable prompt-cache routing** using Pi session IDs on OpenAI-compatible requests
- **Live model discovery** with cache-first startup and background refresh
- **Current capabilities** synchronized from `command-code@1.54.0`
- **Explicit pricing coverage** for every model in the current live Provider API catalog
- **Zero-data-retention header** support through `CMD_ZDR=1`
- **No runtime dependency bundle**—the extension uses Pi's own core packages

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@kushalkhemka/pi-commandcode-provider
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`, then authenticate:

```text
/login
```

Choose **Use a subscription → Command Code**, finish browser login or paste an API key, then select a model:

```text
/model
```

You can also list models non-interactively:

```bash
pi --list-models commandcode
```

### Requirements

- Pi `0.84.4` or newer (tested with `0.84.4` and `0.85.0`)
- Node.js 20 or newer when developing or running scripts directly
- A CommandCode plan with Provider API access

The documented Provider API is unavailable on the Go plan. See [Legacy Go mode](#legacy-go-mode) before opting into the unsupported fallback.

## Compatibility

| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Text streaming    | Incremental deltas                                   | OpenAI Chat Completions / Anthropic Messages |
| Tool calls        | Incremental JSON arguments and complete tool results | Native Pi adapters                           |
| Reasoning         | Model-specific supported effort levels               | Synced CommandCode CLI catalog               |
| Images            | Advertised only for verified vision models           | Native multimodal schemas                    |
| Prompt caching    | Stable `prompt_cache_key` per Pi session             | OpenAI-compatible models                     |
| Anthropic caching | Pi's short-lived cache annotations                   | Anthropic-compatible models                  |
| Usage             | Input, output, cache-read, and cache-write tokens    | Final streamed usage events                  |

| Context overflow  | Normalized for Pi auto-compaction                    | Both documented Provider API routes          |

The primary path uses only these documented endpoints:

```text
GET  /provider/v1/models
POST /provider/v1/chat/completions
POST /provider/v1/messages
```

CommandCode's first-party CLI includes its own prompts, tools, and harness optimizations. This package targets wire-protocol and Pi runtime compatibility; it does not claim to reproduce the proprietary first-party harness.

## Authentication

The recommended flow is Pi's `/login` command. The provider also accepts:

```bash
export COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY="user_..."
```

Existing credentials can be read from:

- `~/.commandcode/auth.json`
- `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`

Supported shapes include:

```json
{ "apiKey": "user_..." }
```

```json
{
  "command-code": {
    "type": "api",
    "key": "user_..."
  }
}
```

Credentials are never written to this repository or included in package output.

## Provider commands

| Command                | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/commandcode-status`  | Show transport, catalog source, model count, cache path, refresh state, and redacted errors |
| `/commandcode-refresh` | Refresh and re-register the live model catalog without restarting Pi                        |
| `/commandcode-quota`   | Show available credits, plan information, and rolling usage windows                         |

## Model discovery and caching

The provider fetches models from `https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1/models`.

The last valid catalog is stored at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/commandcode-models.json
```

Startup behavior is deliberately resilient:

1. A valid cached catalog is registered immediately.
2. A live refresh runs in the background.
3. A successful response atomically replaces the cache.
4. A failed refresh leaves the last valid catalog active.
5. First-time offline startup remains usable, but CommandCode models appear only after connectivity returns and `/commandcode-refresh` succeeds.

Catalog files are written with mode `0600`. Overlapping refresh requests are coalesced.

### Prompt caching

For OpenAI-compatible models, the extension supplies a stable, maximum-64-character `prompt_cache_key` derived from Pi's session ID. This helps compatible upstream routing keep related turns on the same cache path. Setting Pi's cache retention to `none` disables the field.

For Anthropic-compatible models, Pi applies its native short-lived cache annotations. The extension does not claim unsupported long-retention behavior.

## Reasoning, tools, and images

Reasoning and vision capabilities are generated from the published CommandCode CLI catalog. Each model exposes only the thinking levels accepted by its current metadata.

Vision-capable models accept image blocks from direct user messages and tool results. Unknown or explicitly text-only models remain text-only, preventing lossy requests.

Provider API streaming is delegated to Pi's native adapters. This preserves:

- interleaved reasoning and text
- fragmented tool-call arguments
- multiple concurrent tool calls
- final usage-only chunks
- cancellation and bounded retry behavior
- correct cached-token accounting

## Pricing

The Provider API catalog does not currently include rates. This extension therefore maintains an explicit pricing overlay sourced from the [CommandCode pricing page](https://commandcode.ai/docs/resources/pricing-limits).

The current live catalog is checked daily. CI fails when a model is added without both:

- an explicitly reviewed price entry, including free models
- a synchronized catalog fixture

Displayed costs are estimates. CommandCode's usage page remains authoritative for actual billing, promotions, and time-dependent rates.

| `COMMANDCODE_QUOTA_BOARD_URL`    | disabled              | Send final Pi usage to a running local Quota Board                    |
| `COMMANDCODE_QUOTA_BOARD_TOKEN`  | —                     | Bearer token for a non-loopback Quota Board                           |
| `OPENSEC_ROUTER_URL`             | disabled              | Lease a sticky CommandCode key from an OpenSec control plane          |
| `OPENSEC_ROUTER_TOKEN`           | provider credential   | Master token used only to obtain and rotate a leased key              |

Legacy aliases `COMMANDCODE_API_KEY`, `COMMANDCODE_ZDR`, and existing auth-file shapes remain accepted for migration compatibility.

## CommandCode Quota Board

The repository includes a separate [multi-account quota dashboard](./quota-board/README.md) with pure-black and light themes, global and per-key statistics, rolling quota windows, associated account emails, and encrypted local key storage.

To populate its model and cache charts automatically from Pi's final streamed usage events:

```bash
export COMMANDCODE_QUOTA_BOARD_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8787"
```

The provider sends a one-way, best-effort usage event after each completed or failed request. It sends a short hash fingerprint—not the API key—so the board can match the event to an account already connected there. Dashboard availability never delays or breaks a Pi response.

### Sticky multi-account leases

The Quota Board can also act as a lightweight key control plane. Pi obtains one CommandCode key for the active session, then sends requests and streams responses **directly between Pi and CommandCode**:

```bash
export OPENSEC_ROUTER_URL="https://cc.opensec.in"
export OPENSEC_ROUTER_TOKEN="<master router token>"
```

The first request for a Pi session obtains the eligible account with the highest safe remaining quota across its 5-hour, weekly, and monthly limits. The assignment stays in process memory for the entire session. There is no five-minute renewal, polling loop, or control-plane request between successful prompts. If CommandCode rejects the assigned key with an authentication, credit, quota, or rate-limit response, the provider requests one replacement lease, excludes the failed account, and retries the request once with the new key.

The control plane is therefore outside the generation data path. It sees lease metadata and asynchronous final usage, but prompts, tool calls, streamed tokens, and responses do not pass through it. Because Pi receives the upstream key, use this mode only on a trusted Pi host and always connect to the control plane over TLS.

### Cost, cache, TTFT, and TPS

The provider measures each direct CommandCode stream and exposes a running summary with:

```text
/commandcode-metrics
```

- **Weighted cache hit:** cache-read tokens divided by all prompt-side tokens (`new input + cache read + cache write`).
- **Weighted TPS:** output tokens divided by summed generation time, measured from the first text/reasoning token through completion.
- **TTFT:** time from starting the direct provider request to its first text/reasoning token.
- **Estimated cost:** Pi token usage multiplied by this package's reviewed CommandCode pricing overlay.

The Pi footer shows the running estimated cost, weighted cache hit, and weighted TPS. When a lease is active, the same measurements are reported asynchronously against that lease. CommandCode does not expose an OpenRouter-style per-generation reconciliation endpoint, so the package labels pricing as estimated instead of presenting it as an exact provider charge.

## Legacy Go mode

CommandCode's documentation excludes Go from Provider API access. This extension therefore keeps the undocumented `/alpha/generate` fallback **disabled by default**.

If you understand that the endpoint is unsupported and may change without notice, enable it explicitly:

```bash
export COMMANDCODE_ENABLE_LEGACY_GO=1
```

Legacy mode includes streaming reasoning, incremental tool arguments, usage accounting, bounded retries, and `pause_turn` continuation. It is not covered by the public Provider API compatibility guarantee.

## Troubleshooting

### No CommandCode models appear

```text
/commandcode-status
/commandcode-refresh
```

Check the reported endpoint, cache state, and redacted warning. On first use, live model discovery must succeed once before offline startup can use a cache.

### `401` or missing credentials

Run `/login` again, or verify that `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` is available to the Pi process. Avoid placing tokens directly in shell history, repository files, or issue reports.

### `403 upgrade_required`

Your account likely does not include Provider API access. Upgrade to a supported plan or knowingly opt into [Legacy Go mode](#legacy-go-mode).

### Long request appears idle

Pi's provider timeout and retry settings apply. A value of `httpIdleTimeoutMs: 0` can be useful for models that pause for long reasoning periods, but consider the risk of genuinely stuck connections.
